The output weight vectors, once collected into a .xls or .xlsx file with each column corresponding to a weight vector, can be used in the **FBA_Flux_Prediction.m** MATLAB script.

An SBML model in both .xml and .csv format and containing GPR terms formatted with each gene ID surrounded by parentheses, isozymes denoted by OR, members of a complex denoted by AND, and all isozymes and complexes surrounded by parentheses, as shown in the *fetchComponents()* function info below. Reactions in your model must end with a two character identifier indicating what tissue they map to (the script is currently setup to recognize **_lf** for leaf, **_st** for stem, and **_rt** for root. The functions will need to be modified to recognize others).\n",
